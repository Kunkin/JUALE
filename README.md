Geometric analysis of the surface of a solute and its effect on the approximation of its solvation energy

In this repository I show you how I make an extensive analysis of the effect of curvature, for this I try 1442 ways to approximate the free energy of solatation from the geometry of 502 species of solutes (molecules).

The [`Juale 3.0 - Trimesh.ipynb`](JUALE/Juale_3.0_-_Trimesh.ipynb) file is the main algorithm, in which the meshes of the solutes are worked out in 1442 ways and then the results are analyzed and compared with David Mobley's database. Both the meshes and the database are located inside the `mobley_test` folder. Inside this folder the species are listed in their folders with their meshes. You will also find the theoretical result for the non-polar solvation energies in the [`mobley_results_clean.txt`](JUALE/mobley_results_clean.txt) file and results for the free energy of Van Der Waals in the [`vdw_energy_d20.txt`](JUALE/vdw_energy_d20.txt) file.

[`itinerario.npy`](JUALE/itinerario.npy), [`resultado_nespecies.npy`](JUALE/resultado_nespecies.npy) and [`party.npy`](JUALE/party.npy) files are databases generated by the main algorithm and speed up the analysis. This way it is not necessary to do them every time the program is run.

The rest of the files with `.svg` extension are images and diagrams that were used for the development of my [memory](JUALE/Memory_Echaiz_Bielitz.pdf) (score 100/100).
